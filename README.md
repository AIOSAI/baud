# BAUD

BAUD is the AIPass desktop: one window that holds the whole citizen fleet and
puts every agent one click away. It is a Tauri 2 application — a Rust backend
in `app/src-tauri/`, a React + TypeScript frontend in `app/src/` — and Linux is
the platform it actually works on (the activity scan reads `/proc`, the camera
button speaks XDG portal; on other targets those two degrade to "nothing
running" and an honest error).

Three sentences of doctrine, because everything else follows from them:

- **The fleet view reads.** `fleet_snapshot` takes no path arguments, writes
  nothing, and every fallible read degrades to a default instead of failing the
  snapshot.
- **The terminal is the operator.** The seat is one PTY running the operator's
  own shell at their own privileges. BAUD types into a terminal only on a click,
  and only the command lines documented below. (Two other pane kinds run their
  own PTYs: monitor panes, which have no keyboard at all, and help shells, which
  do.)
- **BAUD edits config, it does not own it.** Two commands write files
  (`agent_settings_write`, `baud_settings_write`) plus one flag file
  (`hooks_sound_set`). Everything they touch belongs to someone else, so the
  writes are surgical and refuse rather than guess.

## Running it

```
cd app && npm run tauri dev
```

That is where the current app lives. `npm run tauri dev` starts Vite on port
1420 (pinned, `strictPort`) and runs a debug build of the Rust binary in a Tauri
window: frontend edits hot-reload, Rust edits rebuild and restart the app.

BAUD resolves its **anchor** without hardcoding anything: `AIPASS_ROOT` when it
is set (and it must contain `src/aipass`, or BAUD reports that instead of
guessing), otherwise the first ancestor of the working directory that contains
`src/aipass`. From there the header's project switcher can seat the view in any
other project BAUD discovered.

**The release binary.** `npm run tauri build` produces
`app/src-tauri/target/release/baud` (running `tsc && vite build` first);
`bundle.active` is `false` in `tauri.conf.json`, so a build produces the
binary, not installers. Last built 2026-08-12 18:52, current through m12 —
rebuilt with the room-end fixes, because the launcher's binary is what the
operator actually opens tomorrow. The desktop launcher
(`~/.local/share/applications/baud.desktop`) execs this binary directly, so a
rebuild IS the deploy; its `Path=` seats the process inside the AIPass tree,
which is how the release app's ancestor-walk finds its anchor.

## The window

One column, no page scroll: header, fleet strip, workbench (the only element
that flexes), footer.

**Header, left to right.** The `BAUD` wordmark and the project chip; then the
totals (citizens, dispatched, interactive, unread mail, plans), two monitor
traffic lights (`prax`, `commons`), the camera, the bell, BAUD's own settings
gear, and the zoom chip.

**Footer.** The resolved project root, and the poll status — how long ago the
last snapshot landed and the current cadence.

The fleet polls every 5 seconds by default; the interface settings can move that
to 2, 10 or 30 seconds, and the change takes effect on the spot. The per-card
git figure keeps its own slower 15-second tick, which is not configurable — a
subprocess per card per tick is real work and uncommitted-file counts do not
move second to second.

**Zoom.** The `− 100% +` chip scales the whole window, terminal included;
`ctrl +` / `ctrl -` / `ctrl 0` and ctrl+scroll do the same, captured at the
window so they beat the focused shell. The level persists in `localStorage`;
clicking the percentage resets it.

**The project switcher.** The chip beside the wordmark names the project the
fleet view is seated in. A project is a directory sealed by a
`<NAME>_REGISTRY.json`: the filename stem is the canonical name, and the fleet
directory is the parent of the registry's own first `branches[].path` — no
layout guessing. BAUD's census is the anchor, its `projects/*`, and the anchor's
siblings; a seal that lists no branch paths, or whose branches sit at the
project root, never makes the menu. Discovery is backend-owned: the frontend
picks a NAME from the census and there is deliberately no way to hand the
webview-facing commands a path, so seating elsewhere moves the read fence rather
than weakening it. Reseating empties the reading room (its tabs point where the
fence now refuses to read), closes any open settings panel, re-reads BAUD's
settings from the new root, and re-polls immediately. The terminal is untouched.

## Cards

One citizen, one card. Strip order: dispatched first, then interactive, then
alphabetical. The strip scrolls sideways rather than wrapping, so the workbench
below never loses height as the fleet grows.

- **Lamp** — amber pulse: dispatched (`.ai_mail.local/.dispatch.lock` exists).
  Steady green: interactive (a live claude with no `-p`/`--print` has its cwd
  inside the branch). Dim: neither.
- **Badge** — `dispatched`, `live`, or a quiet `room` when a tmux room exists
  with nothing live in it. A trailing `⧉` means the live session is one BAUD
  did not create; hovering names it.
- **Sub badge** — amber `N sub` while sub-agents are running inside the branch's
  session. Sub-agents never appear in the process table (they run inside the
  parent claude), so the count comes off disk: async agents by the freshness of
  their own `subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl` (180-second window), blocking agents by
  `Agent`/`Task` spawn calls with no matching result in the transcript tail.
  Only transcripts written in the last 15 minutes are consulted.
- **`?`** — opens a help terminal for this branch (see *Help terminals*).
- **Gear** — opens this branch's settings panel (see *Settings*).
- **Figures** — every number is a door. `mail` and `open` are counted live from
  `.ai_mail.local/inbox.json` and open it; `plans` comes from
  `DASHBOARD.local.json` and opens it; `todos` comes from the dashboard too but
  opens `.trinity/local.json`; `⎇ git` is a count of uncommitted files and opens
  the diff tab. The dashboard's summary line is deliberately not on the card —
  it restated the same figures.
- **Age** — `updated <age>`, from the dashboard's `last_updated`, styled stale
  when it gets old.
- **Buttons** — `files` docks the branch's file tree. `watch` opens a read-only
  monitor pane scoped to this branch. Then the launch door: a branch with a live
  interactive claude in a session — its own room, or one BAUD did not create —
  shows a single `▸ attach`; otherwise `▸ resume` (when there is anything to
  resume) beside `fresh`, or a single `▸ claude` when the branch has no
  transcripts at all.

The `?`, the gear and the button row render only for citizens — a directory
without `.trinity/passport.json` gets a card, but no doors.

**What a launch button actually types**, one visible line, on the click:

```
cd '<branch dir>' && command claude --permission-mode bypassPermissions [-c | --resume <id>]
```

`command claude` skips the `~/.bashrc` boot shim — which intercepts `claude` and
`claude --permission-mode …` inside a `.trinity` directory and routes them
through @hooks' `session_boot` attach-first menu — because the button press
already answered that menu's question. Resume picks its own door: `-c`
when an interactive transcript exists, `--resume <id>` when the only history is
headless dispatch runs, which `-c` refuses. No model flag is ever passed; models
are set in the branch's own settings file (see *Settings*).

## Rooms and the seat model

Every agent's session lives in a persistent tmux room — `baud-<branch>`, or
`baud-<project>-<branch>` in a seated non-anchor project, so two projects'
same-named branches can never attach to each other's sessions. The room belongs
to the tmux server, not to this window; BAUD's terminal is a window into it.

- **Open a card** — `tmux new-session -A -s <room> -c <branch dir>`, chained
  with `set-option mouse on`. Creates on first visit, attaches after that.
- **Switch cards** — the old client is SIGHUPed, which for a tmux client is a
  detach. The agent you left keeps working.
- **Close BAUD** — every room loses its window. Sessions, monitors and builds
  keep running.
- **`⇠ detach` / `✕ end room`** — the terminal's corner buttons in a room.
  `end room` (`tmux kill-session`) is the ONE door that actually ends a session;
  its hover text names the exact tmux session the click will kill. The scratch
  shell (no card) keeps a plain `✕ kill`, which is a real SIGHUP to the process
  group — a claude running there stays resumable from its transcript.

**An ended room stays dead** (Patrick ruling 2026-08-12). Nothing in BAUD
reopens it: not the next poll, not a hot reload, not the next app launch. The
one door back is the operator opening that card again — a click on `attach`,
`resume` or `fresh` clears the mark and the branch behaves normally from then
on. The mark is local intent (`localStorage`, keyed per project and branch),
recorded only after tmux confirms the kill: a room that refused to die is still
alive, and BAUD says so instead of pretending. This exists because the ruling
was broken the day it was made — see *The startup agent* under Settings.

**Sessions BAUD did not create.** A branch whose own room is absent can still
hold a live agent: @hooks' boot shim seats a typed `claude` in `aipass-<branch>`,
the Telegram fleet wakes agents in `telegram-<branch>`. The snapshot reads panes,
not just session names, so those show up as the branch's `outside_room` and the
card's doors act on them: the badge wears a `⧉` and names the session on hover,
the launch door reads `▸ attach` (never a second claude in a branch that already
has one), and `✕ end room` ends that session. Before this, `end room` on such a
card targeted a `baud-<branch>` that did not exist — a silent no-op, which is
why @aipass looked immortal (Patrick-caught 2026-08-12).

A session is a candidate only when tmux reports one of its panes running
`claude` with its working directory inside the branch. The narrowness is the
point: a looser test would let BAUD adopt the operator's own tmux window and
type a claude command line into it. A claude install that reports some other
pane command simply never matches, and the card falls back to the behaviour it
had before. BAUD still CREATES only its own `baud-` rooms, and an existing
`baud-<branch>` always wins over an outside session.

The staged claude command is typed only where it can land at a prompt: into a
room this spawn just created, or one the snapshot says holds no live claude.
Attaching to a live claude types nothing — the click lands you mid-conversation.

**One PTY, one seat.** Rooms run in parallel; attention is singular. There is no
"max agents" constant anywhere in the code: N rooms plus one seat is arithmetic.

The tmux verbs in this codebase are exactly: `new-session -A`, `list-panes -a`,
`has-session`, `kill-session`, `set-option mouse`. Room lookups use tmux's `=`
exact-match prefix, and room names sanitize everything outside `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`
to `-`. `new-session -A` is what lets one code path both create BAUD's own room
and attach to a session someone else made.

## The terminal

A real PTY running `$SHELL` (falling back to `/bin/bash`) through portable-pty's
login-shell path, opened in the seated project's root. Output streams to
xterm.js base64-encoded, because a 4KB read can split a multi-byte character and
only raw bytes let xterm's decoder stitch it back together. Teardown signals the
whole process group — SIGHUP, 400ms of grace, then SIGKILL — so background jobs
are not orphaned. Scrollback is 5000 lines.

**Slash-command chips.** When the attached room's branch shows a live
interactive claude, `/memo`, `/prep` and `/compact` appear beside the corner
buttons. One click types the command, waits 150ms for the slash palette to
settle, then sends `\r` (a carriage return — claude's raw-mode input treats a
linefeed as text). The hover text explains what each ritual is for. `/clear` is
deliberately not a chip: the command that discards a conversation keeps its
typing friction.

**Ctrl+click is a door**, on two layers. Claude wraps file citations in OSC 8
`file://` hyperlinks, and BAUD's link handler claims them (xterm drops non-http
links entirely by default). Plain-text paths in any output go through the
`resolve_paths` command: a mention only underlines if it resolves to a real file
inside the fence — the seated room's branch directory first, then the project
root. Both open in a reading-room tab at the cited line. URLs go to the system
browser through the opener plugin's url-only grant. Plain clicks stay tmux's;
only the ctrl-chord activates.

**Dropping a file** anywhere on the window puts its path (quoted if it needs it)
into the chat box, unsubmitted — the same thing dropping onto a real terminal
does.

## The workbench

Open files, diffs, monitors and help shells live as tabs beside the terminal.
The terminal is never unmounted — hidden panes are display-hidden, so claude
keeps streaming underneath while you read.

**The reading room.** Card figures and ctrl+clicked paths open read-only
CodeMirror panes; the `files` button docks a lazily-loaded directory tree.
The git badge opens the branch's full uncommitted diff in patch syntax, and diff
tabs refetch every time they return to the front (a diff goes stale the moment
the agent keeps working); file tabs load once. Every path the frontend sends is
canonicalized and must sit inside the seated project's root, viewers cap at
512 KB and flag the truncation, binaries are refused, and the tree skips `.git`,
`node_modules`, `target`, `__pycache__`, `.venv`, `dist`.

**Monitor panes (read-only).** The header's two traffic lights open
`drone @prax monitor run` (mission control, all branches) and
`drone @prax monitor run commons` (the live social feed); a card's `watch`
button opens `drone @prax monitor run <branch>` in its own `watch:<branch>` tab.
A light is green exactly while its tab exists, so the toggle, the tab's `✕`, the
pane's corner button and the monitor dying on its own all reset it through the
same door.

These panes have no keyboard, and the enforcement is doubled: xterm runs with
`disableStdin`, and the backend's `pty_write` refuses any session flagged
read-only. The command is composed backend-side from a fixed shape — the
frontend passes a target token, never a command line — and the token must match
`[a-z0-9_,-]+`, which is unit-tested against shell-smuggling shapes. Monitors
spawn through the login shell (`-l -c`) so `drone` resolves from the operator's
own PATH.

**Help terminals.** The `?` on a card opens a real shell seated in that branch
with the branch's help command already run — `drone @<branch> --help`, except
for `aipass`, which is the ecosystem's one routing exception and asks its own
binary (`aipass --help`). The keyboard is deliberately ON: the point is
continuing the investigation. There is no filter on what can be typed, because a
typed-input filter would be theater; the framing does the work, exactly as it
does for the scratch shell. Typing `exit`, or the pane's `✕ kill`, closes the
tab.

## The bell

ai_mail appends every notification event — mail delivered, agent waking,
dispatch finished — to `<project root>/.aipass/notifications.jsonl`, one JSON
object per line (`ts`, `kind`, `title`, `body`, `source`). Desktop toasts are
retired: ai_mail's notifier (`notify.py` 2.0.0, "Notification Feed Writer") has
no D-Bus and no notify-send path left in it, and no fallback that still toasts.

BAUD only reads that feed. The backend tails the last 256 KB, skips lines that
do not parse (a torn trailing write or a truncated first line must never take
the bell down), and returns at most 200 events; the bell then keeps as many as
the interface settings say. A missing feed is a quiet bell, not an error.

Nothing clears itself. The badge stays until the operator clicks **clear**,
which wipes the lot in one click. Clearing is local — a cleared-up-to timestamp
in `localStorage`, keyed per project — so the feed file is never written by
BAUD, and two BAUD windows never fight over read flags. Rows click to expand
from their two-line preview to the whole event.

The chime, when enabled, is synthesized with the Web Audio API — two short sine
notes — because the CSP allows no external assets and a sound file shipped
beside the binary is a sound that eventually goes missing. It fires only when a
poll brings an event newer than the previous poll's newest; the first list after
launch is history, not news.

## Settings

Two gears, two files, one doctrine: **BAUD is an editor of operator-owned
config, never its owner.**

### The card gear — one agent's claude settings

Writes `<branch>/.claude/settings.local.json`, claude's own file. Operators keep
permission blocks, MCP server lists, hooks and env in there, so the write is
surgical: the existing document is parsed, exactly three keys are touched, and
every other key is handed back untouched.

| Panel row | Key on disk |
| --- | --- |
| model | `model` |
| auto-compact | `autoCompactEnabled` |
| threshold | `autoCompactWindow` |

The patch is three-state, so "leave it alone" and "unset it" can never be
confused: a field absent from the patch is not touched, a field explicitly
`null` REMOVES the key, a field with a value sets it. Choosing **Inherit** for
the model is the null case — the key is deleted, not blanked. The panel sends a
field only when the operator's value differs from what the file effectively says
today (the file's value, or claude's own default when the key is absent), so an
untouched slider stamps nothing.

Failure mode is refusal. A settings file that exists but does not parse as a
JSON object errors out and nothing is written — losing a deny-rule to a settings
toggle is the worst bug this file could ship, and overwriting what we cannot
read is never the safer choice. Writes land through a temp file in the same
directory and a rename, so a reader never sees a half-file. One cosmetic
consequence: keys come out sorted, so untouched keys keep their values but can
change line order.

Model strings pass through opaque — which model ids exist is claude's business
and it changes without us. A model the file already carries that the panel does
not list stays listed verbatim rather than rendering as Inherit. BAUD never
passes a model on the command line — it writes the key in claude's own settings
file, and claude reads that file when a session starts in the branch, so the
choice is not tied to BAUD's launch button.

The threshold slider runs 100k–1M in 50k steps and shows 350k when the file is
silent — that is a reading of claude's default, not a value the operator chose.
The `memory caps` row is a disabled placeholder and writes nothing.

### The header gear — BAUD's own interface

Writes `<project root>/.aipass/baud.settings.json`, per seated project. The
backend treats the document as opaque: a shallow top-level merge, `null` removes
a key, and it hands the whole document back as written.

| Row | Key | Default when absent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| startup agent | `startup_agent` | none — BAUD opens nothing |
| poll every | `poll_interval_ms` | 5000 (menu: 2s/5s/10s/30s, accepted range 1s–300s) |
| bell keeps | `bell_max_events` | 200 (menu: 50/100/200, accepted range 1–500) |
| bell chime | `bell_sound` | off |

Absence and nonsense both fall back to the default — the file is
operator-editable by hand, and the app must keep running rather than poll every
0 ms. A stored value the menu does not offer stays listed instead of being
silently rewritten.

**Startup agent** fires once per app run, as soon as the first snapshot and the
settings have both landed, and only if the operator has not already picked a
card. It goes through the same `launch` door a card click uses, with the card's
own judgment: a live session attaches, a branch with history resumes, anything
else starts fresh. A named agent with no card in the seated project is a console
warning, not a fault banner.

Two things hold it back, and both exist because it resurrected an ended room the
day it shipped: BAUD is developed in the window it is used in, so every frontend
save hot-reloads the app, and a once-per-app-run guard held in a React ref is
re-armed by every one of those remounts. The guard now lives in `sessionStorage`
— one shot per app RUN, not per mount — and the startup agent refuses outright
to open a branch whose room the operator ended. `app/src/intent.ts` holds both
marks and nothing else; it is the only place in the frontend where an operator
decision is stored rather than derived.

**Hook sounds** is the one row that is not a setting of ours, and the panel says
so. AIPass hook sounds are muted by the existence of a flag file named
`aipass-hooks-muted` in the OS temp directory (@hooks' own switch: the file
exists = muted). BAUD is a second hand on that same switch — it flips on click
rather than on save, both directions are idempotent, the state is read live on
open because a shell or another window may have flipped it, and nothing about it
is mirrored into `baud.settings.json` where it would drift. The flag lives in
the temp directory, so it resets on reboot; that is the flag's design, not ours.

## The camera

One click opens the compositor's own screenshot picker — region,
window or full screen — through the XDG Desktop Portal's interactive mode. On
Wayland no application may read screen pixels directly, and the portal is the
one sanctioned door; BAUD ships its own portal client (`ashpd`, pure Rust over
D-Bus) rather than shelling out to a screenshot binary. The capture is copied to
`~/Pictures/BAUD/baud-<stamp>.png` and its path is typed into the chat box,
unsubmitted — claude reads images by path, so the path is the delivery, and
Enter stays the operator's. The button goes quiet while a request is out and
carries the failure (including a cancelled picker) in its tooltip. On non-Linux
targets the command returns an honest error.

## How BAUD reads the fleet

| Signal | Source |
| --- | --- |
| citizen | `.trinity/passport.json` exists |
| dispatched | `.ai_mail.local/.dispatch.lock` exists |
| interactive | `/proc` scan: argv[0] is `claude`, no `-p`/`--print`, cwd inside the branch |
| resume kind | `~/.claude/projects/<munged path>/*.jsonl` — interactive transcripts carry `"type":"file-history-snapshot"` entries within their first 64 KB; headless dispatch runs never do |
| sub badge | `subagents/agent-*.jsonl` freshness (async agents, 180s) plus unmatched `Agent`/`Task` spawn calls in the transcript tail (blocking agents); sessions idle over 15 minutes are skipped |
| mail figures | `.ai_mail.local/inbox.json` message statuses — the dashboard's cached counts drift (12 of 17 cards were wrong when checked, 2026-08-10) |
| plans / todos / age | the branch's `DASHBOARD.local.json` |
| room | one `tmux list-panes -a` per snapshot: session names, plus the cwd of every pane running `claude` (which is what finds sessions BAUD did not create) |
| git figure and diff | the installed `git` binary, `diff HEAD --relative -- .` in the branch directory — the only git verb BAUD runs |
| projects | sealed `<NAME>_REGISTRY.json` census; fleet dir from the registry's own `branches[].path` |
| files and viewer | `list_dir` + `read_file_text`, fenced to the seated project's root |
| terminal links | OSC 8 `file://` hyperlinks and plain-text mentions, both through the fenced `resolve_paths` |
| notifications | `<project root>/.aipass/notifications.jsonl`, written by ai_mail |
| hook sounds | the `aipass-hooks-muted` flag file in the OS temp dir |

Every fallible read degrades to a default and records the failure in the payload
— one bad file never takes down the snapshot.

## The command surface

`invoke_handler` in `app/src-tauri/src/lib.rs` is the canonical inventory —
22 commands, and nothing reaches the backend that is not on this list:

```
fleet_snapshot  list_projects  project_switch
list_dir  read_file_text  resolve_paths  git_changes  git_diff_text
room_kill  screenshot_capture
pty_create  pty_write  pty_resize  pty_kill  monitor_create
notifications_read
agent_settings_read  agent_settings_write
baud_settings_read  baud_settings_write
hooks_sound_get  hooks_sound_set
```

Everything BAUD writes, in full: the two settings files, the hooks mute flag,
the screenshot copy in `~/Pictures/BAUD/`, and bytes into a PTY. There is no
write path to any file the reading room can show you.

The capability grant (`app/src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`) is
`core:default`, the webview zoom setter, and the opener's URL-only permissions —
no shell plugin, no filesystem plugin, no asset protocol. A navigation fence
plugin refuses any navigation off the app's own origin, so no stray link or
`window.open` can turn the fleet view into a `file://` directory listing.

**`src/` is not old app code.** It is the AIPass agent scaffold for @baud, the
project's resident citizen: `apps/baud.py` is the standard auto-discovery CLI
entry point reached as `drone @baud`, with `apps/modules/` and `apps/handlers/`
still empty. `BAUD_REGISTRY.json` names `src/baud/baud` as its one branch, which
makes `src/baud` this project's fleet directory — seat BAUD in the BAUD project
and you get exactly one card.

**`tests/` is a placeholder.** Its README says so: BAUD's real tests live with
their stack, in `app/src-tauri/`. There is no Python surface here and no
frontend test runner installed.

**`CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`** carry the same startup protocol for the agent
working in this directory (read `.trinity/`, use drone, keep memories current);
they are agent instructions, not documentation of the app.

## Development

Stack: Tauri 2 with `portable-pty` and `ashpd` on the Rust side; React 19,
xterm.js and CodeMirror 6 on the frontend; one plain stylesheet. There are no
inline styles anywhere — the CSP forbids them — and `theme.css` is the single
source of the palette, which the terminal panes read back out of the stylesheet
so no second palette can drift.

`app/src/types.ts` mirrors the Rust structs by hand. Change one, change the
other.

Checks, all expected clean:

```
cd app/src-tauri && cargo test      # 49 unit tests; compiling IS the Rust type check
cd app/src-tauri && cargo clippy    # lints
cd app && npx tsc --noEmit          # TypeScript type check
cd app && npm run build             # tsc && vite build - the frontend must actually build
```

There is no seedgo audit lane for this repo: seedgo's checks target AIPass
Python branches, and BAUD is Rust and TypeScript. The four commands above are
the audit.

## How it got here

Eleven milestones over three days, 2026-08-09 to 2026-08-11, and one ruling
answered on the fourth:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| m1 | Tauri 2 fleet monitor, read-only |
| m2 | the terminal in the middle — PTY layer, xterm, centre-stage layout |
| m2.5–m4 | zero-touch switching, resume everywhere, kill button, the reading room |
| m4.5 | click-through figures — every card number opens its source file |
| m5 | the git changes figure and the diff tab |
| m6 | rooms — per-branch tmux sessions; the terminal becomes a window into one |
| m7 | the project switcher — seat the fleet view in any sealed project |
| m8 | the camera, drag-drop paths, and the sub-agent badge |
| m9 | auxiliary panes — the monitor toggles, per-card watch, the help door |
| m10 | the notification bell; desktop toasts retired |
| m11 | settings — the per-agent gear and BAUD's own interface gear |
| m12 | the room-end ruling — ended rooms stay dead, outside sessions surface and end |

Along the way: whole-window zoom, ctrl+click terminal links, slash-command
chips, and the mail-count fix that reads the mailbox instead of the dashboard's
cache.

All eleven milestones are committed; `git log --oneline -1` ends at the m11
settings arc (`5d340b7`). m12 is in the working tree, uncommitted — @baud has
no git write; @devpulse commits this project.
